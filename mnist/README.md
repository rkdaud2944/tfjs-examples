# TensorFlow.js Example: Training MNIST

This example shows you how to train MNIST (using the layers API).

Note: currently the entire dataset of MNIST images is stored in a PNG image we have
sprited, and the code in `data.js` is responsible for converting it into
`Tensor`s. This will become much simpler in the near future.
