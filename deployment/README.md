# TensorFlow.js Deployment Examples

This directory contains simple examples meant to illustrate how to deploy [TensorFlow.js](http://js.tensorflow.org)
models in different deployment scenarios, such as to the web, to a node.js
server, or to a react-native app.

Each example directory is standalone so the directory can be copied to another
project. See the README file within each project for build and install
instructions.
